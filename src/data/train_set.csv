184,B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-08-22,One of favorites.

59,B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-07-23,"I think this product is good, i really like the cooling sensation, but i do agree with others, could use a little more oil, or moisturizer.",Cooling shave,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0,Chennai

This colour, however, Lush Tropics, is not what it appears in the photo.  The actual bottle is much less saturated.  It has more white mixed in so the colour is milkier and softer.

9,B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-01-09,Good product.

I could not give it 5 because I think it's too good. Yes, strange comment so let me explain. I've been looking for a hairdryer that has a good gust of air flowing from the end instead of the warm breezes I seem to keep choosing. (Or the hairdryer purchase before this one that caught on fire after 5 uses). This has so much power that it knots my hair into a mess if I'm not controlling my hair with a brush. I like to flip my head over to get the underneath and get some body. It fried the front of my hair because of the knotted mess. I don't have thin hair. My daughter has extremely thick hair and it did the same thing to hers. If you're looking for a powerful hairdryer then this one is for you. I've never had one with this much power.
What I did like: It has a very long cord. I've had issues with prior hairdryer purchases that had extremely short cords.
The cool setting is nice
I like the way the switches are set up. You can't accidentally switch it off while use it.

Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-09-03,funny!,Five Stars,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0,Delhi

56,B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-12-29,"This is perhaps one of my favorite purchases on Amazon.  I shave both my head and my face with this soap.  I had decided to make the plunge to shaving soap over a year ago.  I have sensitive skin and could not find a foam/gel that worked well for me.  My only complaint is that I feel the fool for ordering the second container almost 5 months ago.  I have still not finished my first one.  I was worried that I would run out so I ordered the next as a backup.  To my surprise it still sits in my drawer.  Not a big deal because it is as soft and fragrant as the day it shipped.

The quality of this product is second to none.  The scent of the soap is excellent.  At the risk of sounding corny, I would say the scent is manly.  heck the whole experience makes you feel kind of bad ass.  The old school experience of using a brush to lather up and apply the soap mixed with the scent has me considering buying a straight razor. Post shave you will find that your skin is soft to the touch and smells great.

If I haven't convinced you to buy this yet then just go away, you're beyond help.  I will leave you with one last nugget of how strongly I feel about this product.  I purchased a container of it for my father.  Of course you have no idea who I am or how much I respect my father.  I assure you that there is only one man that I have respected more and that was my grandfather.

82,B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.
