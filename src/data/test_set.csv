127,B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.
