B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-04-18,This is all it claims to be.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-02-16,Bought this for my son- he loved it!,Super soap!,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0

I have now totally converted and will NEVER go back to any other shaving cream.

I don't love the smell, but I don't hate it either and it is not so strong that it is very noticeable.  I do use a shaving brush with this and so I can't really comment on how it lathers if you say just use your hands and rub it into your face.  Regardless this stuff is just amazing.  I get the closest shave I have ever gotten and ever since I have started using it I haven't gotten any razor burn or little pimples or bumps on my neck like would occasionally happen before I started using Proraso.

I really like nailpolish colors like this.  I have quite a selection in the oxblood/deep red/wine/reddish purple family, including glitters, cremes, shimmers, etc.  So I expected to love the color of this even before I bought it!

I find the color in the bottle looks pretty similar to the color you see when it dries (and also to the image on the screen on the computer I'm currently using).  So you know what you'll be getting.  I'd say this had cool/purplish undertones for a red, it's really more of a wine color.  It has a subtle shimmer and looks really nice with a high-shine topcoat (I used one from Seche Vite).

This went on more smoothly than most polishes I've used lately (over an OPI base coat).  It dried quickly.  I used two coats to get it fully opaque, but depending on your preferences, you might be able to get by with one thick coat.  I got only one tiny bubble that you can hardly even see (I've had much worse bubbling problems with other polishes).  So far, I don't have any shrinking or chips although that might change when I clean house later tonight.  But about 18 hours after application, it still looks nearly perfect.  I'd say this was one of the better-performing Zoya polishes I've used in that regard.  (I have quite a few of them.)",perfect shimmery wine color,"Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO/FPO addresses.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-11-02,"This scent is wonderful and it is a part of my husband's regular rotation.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

B0007M11XQ,"Proraso Shaving Cream, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","The original Proraso shaving classic, this refreshing and toning Shaving Soap is formulated for any beard on any man. This creamy soap produces a thick, elastic lather and is enriched with natural ingredients that make it particularly concentrated and rich. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 3 days, producing an extremely thick and creamy soap that products a soft, rich lather. Eucalyptus Oil tones and purifies your facial hair and skin, Menthol helps refresh and revitalize, and Glycerin helps the blade glide smoothly and reduce razor burn and rashes. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been innovating professional highest-quality products in the shaving world for generations, and has evolved to become a staple of Italian culture. From the first product -- Pre-Shave Cream -- in 1948, to now, the Martelli family principles hold true: to create professional, quality products that deliver a pleasurable and impeccable shave, in the barbershop and at home.', '', 'Short on time? Apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream to your damp face, for optimal results. If using a shaving brush, run it under hot running water for about 30 seconds (if you don&#039;t have time to soak it). Squeeze about 2 centimeter of the Shaving Cream onto your brush, dampen face with warm water, and work the brush into your scruff/stubble. You should be able to achieve an excellent lather in about a minute.', 'If using your hands, work cream and water together between the palm of your hands until suds begin to form. Apply mixture into your stubble using your fingers, massaging in circular movements until a lather forms. This method also works well if youre shaving in the shower.

Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948.

Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

The lid just kind of snaps onto the container and is easy enough to open and close. When you open the container the minty menthol smell is very prominent. The shave soap has a firm texture.

I lather and apply this product using a separate cup and synthetic badger brush. First, I soak my brush in warm water while I am showering. Next, I squeeze out most of the water but not all of it. Now it is time to load the brush, I firmly push it into the shave soap and brush it in a clockwise motion for a while. Once it is nice and loaded I build a good lather. To build my lather I start running my brush in a clockwise motion inside my lather cup. I add a few drops of hot water throughout the lather building process. I keep working it in the shave bowl until I get a nice creamy dollop of shaving awesomeness. Finally, it is time to get this on my face. I just simply wet my face with warm/hot water and thoroughly brush on the lathered shave soap. I usually shave in three passes and just rinse and reload my face after each pass.

This shave soap lathers wonderfully and goes onto my face well. It gives a nice smooth layer of protection. My skin is more on the sensitive side so I was apprehensive about using a menthol product. I do not seem to have too much of an adverse reaction to this product except for some tingling in my face. This container seems to last forever, way longer than any of the canned gel junk you can buy.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-03-25,Feels nice.

As I am over 50, I had been using the serum twice a day; now I am using the serum at night and the makeup n the morning and the results are fantastic.

History: I had eyelash extensions for about a year and really liked them - not having to wear mascara and looking good right out of bed in the morning, but did not like the hassle and expense of maintaining them.  When I stopped getting the extensions my lashes were left short and stubby so I decided to try serum to regrow them.  Did some research and based on reviews here and elsewhere I decided to try GrandeLash.

I was using the serum night and morning and was really seeing good results, but when I re-ordered the serum I decided to use the mascara and liner as well. Once I added the liner and the mascara to the serum, the results really amped up.  My lashes are twice their length now and look as good as when I had the extensions.",I started with the serum only for a month and liked the results,"Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO/FPO addresses.

Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948.

Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-01-17,I like this Soap a lot.

Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

Apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream to your damp face, for optimal results. If using a shaving brush, run it under hot running water for about 30 seconds (if you don&#039;t have time to soak it). Squeeze about 2 centimeter of the Shaving Cream onto your brush, dampen face with warm water, and work the brush into your scruff/stubble.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

So my dilemma was get a close shave and live with the consequences, or get a 12-o'clock shadow with no bumps.

Then one day, while I was at Target, I saw a similar safety razor like this Merkur and it reminded me of the one my late grandfather owned/used for as long as I can remember.  Then it dawned on me that he never complained  or had problems with in-grows or bumps.  Furthermore, he would grow a thicker beard than I never could.

After all, I've spent hundreds of dollar on all the above.

After a couple of shaves, my only regret is I should have looked for this product sooner.  Yes, I have to go a little slower and yes, you have to hold razor at an angle, but guess what? it is designed for you to hold it at an angle, because if you don't it won't cut any of the hair.  Also, the razor is heavier than  any of the plastic ones I've used, but no heavier than the electric ones I tried.  Plus I can get a far better grip on this than any of the electric ones.

As for the cons:
1-No instructions on the box, but it's fairly easy to figure out.  Just unscrew it from the top and the head comes off in 2 pieces
2-This goes without saying, but always hold the blade from the ends as you are installing it -- otherwise you will slice your fingers.
3-My first shave left a burning sensation, most likely because I am used to the disposable ones where I had to give 3-4 passes on the same spot before moving on to the next one.  With this, 1-2 passes should be enough.

Overall, highly recommended.

Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-05-29,"Another winner from Proraso.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-05-17,"This is the first ""quality"" Shaving Soap I've ever used (I used to use the stuff in a can).

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-10-17,"Great shave.

Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-02-28,"After a year of using soap from the drugstore, I broke down and spent a bit more on this, and I'm so glad I did.

B0007M11XQ,"Proraso Shaving Cream, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","The original Proraso shaving classic, this refreshing and toning Shaving Soap is formulated for any beard on any man. This creamy soap produces a thick, elastic lather and is enriched with natural ingredients that make it particularly concentrated and rich. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 3 days, producing an extremely thick and creamy soap that products a soft, rich lather. Eucalyptus Oil tones and purifies your facial hair and skin, Menthol helps refresh and revitalize, and Glycerin helps the blade glide smoothly and reduce razor burn and rashes. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been innovating professional highest-quality products in the shaving world for generations, and has evolved to become a staple of Italian culture. From the first product -- Pre-Shave Cream -- in 1948, to now, the Martelli family principles hold true: to create professional, quality products that deliver a pleasurable and impeccable shave, in the barbershop and at home.', '', 'Short on time? Apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream to your damp face, for optimal results.

Squeeze about 2 centimeter of the Shaving Cream onto your brush, dampen face with warm water, and work the brush into your scruff/stubble. You should be able to achieve an excellent lather in about a minute.', 'If using your hands, work cream and water together between the palm of your hands until suds begin to form.

Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-07-07,Great soap gives good shave.

Well, it would be a streak, but I won't allow that to happen. Because I don't have a huge problem with the gray, and because, when I do get my hair done I'm only matching my natural color, I don't want to go more often than I need. It feels ridiculous to go and spend all that time and money on color when I just have a couple problem areas. At the same time, I am SO self-conscious about my gray that I can't just leave it alone either! Hence, my decision to try this out.

It's been over 2 months since I went to the salon. I purchased this to tide me over until the next trip. Overall, I'm really happy with it! I use the small end to apply the powder to my problem areas. It shade the skin underneath the hair (which I guess is why some people use it to make their thinning hair look fuller) and it also coats the strands with color. It doesn't make the gray hair as dark as the others, but it darkens it enough so that it blends in naturally. I was thrilled!

Apparently, it's supposed to last until the next shampooing. I didn't find this to be true at all. I'll apply it in the morning before work, and if I'm heading out at night I might touch it up again. I'll definitely need to apply it again the next morning.

An irritating side effect is that the powder gets under my nails and makes me look like a serial gardener. This is probably because I'm habitually running my fingers through my hair. It washed out fairy easily, but it was another thing for me to be self-conscious about! Anyway, my solution was to keep my fingernails painted. :)

All in all, four stars! The missing star is due to the fact that it needs reapplication fairly frequently and it sticks under my fingernails. But all in all, I'm thrilled!","Fantastic, with a couple drawbacks",,,1.0

Tap a very tiny amount under the roots and use your fingertips to massage it lightly into your scalp. It doesn't show even on dark hair.

One great suggestion someone gave is to use it to eliminate ""flat hat hair""--apply it before you go out wearing a hat. When you take off your hat, just fluff up your hair. I had my doubts, but tried it before I went out running wearing a snug knit cap, which usually makes one's hair flatter than the proverbial pancake. Finished my run, took off the cap, fluffed up my hair with my fingers and it looked great!

It can last for days--I usually try to go for 2-3 days before I shampoo again. I dampen my fingers, run them through from the roots up, and am ready to go again.

Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-07-29,Scent a little weak.,Four Stars,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0

I kind of was hesitant to buy this one at first but decided that I was going to get it regardless of the previous comments I had read. I have very thick, frizzy hair. For the type if hair I have, I have to always turn the irons on their highest settings. Again, I was hesitant from reading other reviews saying that this iron burned off their hair, and some other crazy reviews!! I am not a professional, however I do know how to do hair, and well. Make sure you're not clamping your hair at the tip and rolling to the root but, that you're rolling your hair from the middle to the root then working your way to the tip. If you don't know how to do this then look a tutorial up on YouTube so you can curl it correctly. This gives you a well rounded curl. Make sure you're using the correct heat setting! I'm not going to use the lowest or middle setting for my hair because I don't have straight, nor thin hair. The box has instructions on the hair type you have, and what heat setting you should use. I saw another comment saying that this worked as a better straightner than a curling iron. Well, don't expect to get a spiral curl from a 1 1/2"" barrel. I bought the 1 1/2"" so I would have pretty loose curls; not tight springy curls. Smaller barrel=tighter springier curls & bigger barrel= looser/ waiver curls. Before you purchase a curling iron, know the type of curl you're wanting and do some research on how what curling iron would benefit you  the most. Next, NEVER EVER spray your hair with hairspray while the hair is in the barrel and being curled. This will cause nasty, and smelly build up gunk on the barrel it will cause the iron not to function correctly; thus leading to your hair not curling! Always spray your hair after you are finished curling. All in all I love this curling iron and will forever reccomend it. This is a professional curling iron, so do some research and have an idea of what you want before you buy it.

Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948.

That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

Originating in Italy, Proraso has been innovating professional highest-quality products in the shaving world for generations, and has evolved to become a staple of Italian culture. From the first product -- Pre-Shave Cream -- in 1948, to now, the Martelli family principles hold true: to create professional, quality products that deliver a pleasurable and impeccable shave, in the barbershop and at home.', '', 'Short on time? Apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream to your damp face, for optimal results. If using a shaving brush, run it under hot running water for about 30 seconds (if you don&#039;t have time to soak it). Squeeze about 2 centimeter of the Shaving Cream onto your brush, dampen face with warm water, and work the brush into your scruff/stubble. You should be able to achieve an excellent lather in about a minute.', 'If using your hands, work cream and water together between the palm of your hands until suds begin to form. Apply mixture into your stubble using your fingers, massaging in circular movements until a lather forms. This method also works well if youre shaving in the shower.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-12-05,Got this last Christmas and my husband loves it.,Five Stars,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0

This did not work for me AT ALL.  It deposited plenty of color on my scalp but didn't coat my grey roots even slightly.

It coated my scalp so thoroughly that it gave me an Eddie Munster hairline.

Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-05-14,Nice and refreshing.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,False,2015-09-06,"The first time a cracked the lid, I was a little worried when I saw the soap inside.

Without the primer, my lashes look spindly and the mascara flakes onto my face. With the primer, this stays on all day better than any other mascara I've used. My lashes look more natural with this product combo than with any other I've tried.

Technique: Timing is essential. You have to put the mascara on while the primer is still wet (less than 15 seconds). I like to use 2 coats of primer without waiting between coats followed immediately by one coat of the mascara.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

Scent is a bit different than I imagined, but hopefully it will grown on me. Shave it provided was slightly better than the cheap $1 VDH soap you can purchase anywhere. Been using same blade and set-up judge a difference.

Overall, not a bad product, but could be better for the price I paid. I'll certainly use this tub to the end, but might stick to the VDH soap since it's conveniently accessible and cost effective. Will update if over time this shave soap changes my mind.

*Changed rating from 4 stars to 5*

Alright, I take it back.. This shave soap IS the bee's knees! After several shaves, I am convinced this soap is well worth the asking price for several reasons.

1) The Lather -- It consistently takes only a few quick passes with my new badger brush to whip up a nice, thick, creamy lather that stays the consistency I want it to throughout the duration of my triple-pass shave.

2) The Scent -- At first, I was a bit disappointed in the scent everyone was ranting and raving about, but after a few shaves, I noticed just how pleasantly the minty/eucalyptus scent lingers after the shave. I love it, my girlfriend loves it, everyone's a happy camper!

3) The Shave -- This soap whips up into a phenomenal lather which provides ample protection during the shave, and when rinsed away, leaves your face feeling wonderfully soft and moisturized. The best part of the shave for me, though, is the very gentle tingling sensation of the menthol if you are to lather up and let sit for a minute. If you make multiple passes with a new application each time, the sensation is only heightened.

Thanks, Amazon!

I've not been shaving with this soap for several weeks and have only found one complaint. It seems to leave a residue on the chrome plating of my safety razor that is not able to be simply rinsed off. I have to take a damp washcloth and detail the razor handle after every shave. Let me clarify: it's not clumping up in my razor, in fact, any build up rinses away from the head very easily; however, the product seems to leave a light, cloudy film anywhere it comes in contact with the chrome plating. I never experienced this problem with the cheap $1 VDH soap, therefore, I thought it was worth mentioning. After I've finished this tub, I may be so annoyed with having to detail the handle every time, that I may try a different product. That being said, I stand by this product's quality shave experience.","*Updated* - Definitely the bee's knees, but isn't perfect.",Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0

Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-01-16,"This is my favorite soap.

That's about all the positives I have to say. The menthol smell became way more apparent when creating the lather, almost too overwhelming. After taking a shower and using a brand-new Derby DE blade,  it took three full passes  to get an acceptable shave. On my previous products it only took at most two passes. And then I had to go back a fourth time in select areas. It was not a comfortable shave and I was left with multiple knicks  and a overbearing menthol smell I wasn't too comfortable with.

The Proraso sensitive skin product that comes in the bowl is far superior for me. It smells better and works better for me. My most recent shaving cream purchase was Cremo which worked really well also, and the smell wasn't too bad, and only smelled better as I used it.

But I've used this product twice so far and have had poor results both times. I'll continue to use it because there's just so much product left and I'll hope that things improve.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-12-31,I see why this is so popular in Italy!,Five Stars,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0

After washing and applying heat protectant, in sections I do about 1-2 pass throughs with a flat iron and then I use this curling iron to create beautiful curls. This curling iron makes effortless curls, and in my opinion better than a flat iron or a wand. Once you get the hang of using the clamp and not letting it pull your hair, you have the potential for your curls to look great. Make sure the clamp stays on top is what my mom told me!

I bet most bad reviews for this curling iron are user error or people with unusually fine hair who probably can't handle much heat application anyway. I get a tons of compliments when I use this product. I'm a little concerned about the amount of heat I'm applying to my hair, but I only use it on freshly washed hair.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948.

Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

Just a little more than natural nails. As another reviewer said, sort of like buffed nails look.

I was disappointed that after 3 coats or so it began to peel away at the edges. I found it harder to keep my nails covered than with other nail building products.

Also, it just did not work as well as the Nail-Aid brand product or the Barielle that I was using. I stopped using the other products and only used the OPI for a month. My nails, which had started to grow and strengthen a bit with a few months of treatments with the others, peeled and weakened considerably. I had to stop using it and buy some more Nail-Aid. Both the Nail-Aid and Barielle were at Ross for under $4 and the Nail-Aid products can be found inexpensively on Amazon as well.

With such high reviews, I am really surprised that my experience was not in line with others. But I saw a significant decline when using it for 4 weeks so I personally can't recommend it.

Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

Like a lot of folks, I grew tired of paying for expensive blade cartridges and decided to go back to the future with this Merkur DE safety razor for my woman parts like legs and underarms. I'm using Feather blades with it. And I'm so glad I made the change!

I now get it when folks say safety razors shave soooo much closer than a multi-blade razor.

As to this specific Merkur razor...I like the long handle on this as well as the grip on the razor. I shave at the end of my shower and my hands are wet. I haven't had any problems keeping a light grip on the handle. I'm still adjusting to wet shaving but, having followed the advice of other experienced wet shavers, I've only had a one small nick since I started.

I can't speak yet about the razor's longetivity since I just purchased it but it looks like it's well constructed. And I liked it well enough to buy a second to keep in my toiletry kit for travel.

I also bought a stand to keep the razor dry between uses and a leather travel pouch so I don't have to worry about cutting myself when reaching into my toiletry kit while traveling. All together, 2 Merkur safety razors, 100 blades, the stand, and travel pouch cost me less than the costs of blade cartridges for 1 year. And the blades will last for 1-1/2 to 2 years and the razors for years (decades?) to come.

All in all, a very satisfying purchase.

Other folks have commented about needing to make adjustments to how you shave like no putting pressure on the razor, etc. Make sure you watch some videos or read some blog articles about the right way to wet shave. Although I learned how to shave with this style razor, I needed the refresher. Rather than use shaving cream, I'm using hair conditioner and it works great.

It does take me a little longer to wet shave but that may be because I'm being ultra careful as a once again new wet shaver. But really for me it's only about 5 or so extra minutes and it's definitely worth the time.

I'll never go back to blade cartridges again.",Love the razor and will never go back to blade cartridges again,"Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO/FPO addresses.

I heard the resetting button helped, so i did thay a few times. But last week, the hot air just started not to work. The air is cool no matter what we do.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-08-26,This product has changed my shaving routine forever.

What I do with this product is NOT shake it directly onto my hair. I read that is someone elses review. If you shake it directly onto your hair, it's a clumpy sticky chunk. So I shake a tiny bit in my palm, smack my palms together, and rub them through parts of my hair, with my head upside down. Repeat until desired body. Then I hit certain spots with my head upright, until everything is plumped but not crazy looking. I can shake my head and the hair moves, and I can scrunch it a little throughout the day when it's getting limp.

I need to revise my original review of this razor. OMG was I doing it wrong! I sincerely apologize to the fine folks over at Merkur. When I initially got the razor, I did give it a try for about a month and was unimpressed with the results. My shaves were not clean, and I continued to break out after each use. Therefore, I put the blame on the razor. However, the fault was actually in my technique and also in the products I used in my shaving regimen.

After a pretty serious breakout of ingrown hairs, I decided enough was enough and visited the experts at the Art of Shaving and Sephora to discuss shaving and general skincare. I completely expected to have a lot of expensive products rammed down my throat, but I ended up getting a lot of great advice. First, the Feather blade I was using was too sharp. For my skin type, a thicker (or smoother) blade would be a better choice. I purchased a Gilette Platinum blade instead. Second, the razor I had been using was too aggressive. After initially giving up on the Merkur, I had reverted to an open-comb safety razor I purchased at a local beauty store. I am now using the Merkur razor with the Gilette Platinum blade. Third, I needed to have a shaving regimen. I purchased the pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and after-shave balm from The Art of Shaving (all unscented), and it's completely changed how I approach Shaving. And fourth, i really needed to get a skin care regimen in place that included a proper cleanser, toner, and moisturizer.

It's been 2 weeks now and my skin looks incredible. My shaves have never been so comfortable or lasted this long. I know what I described above sounds like a lot for the average guy, but trust me, it's worth it. That old saying, ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" is absolutely true!

--------

I'm unimpressed by this razor. I bought it after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon. I switched to using safety razors about a year ago and was enjoying having less irritation and closer shaves. I purchased a safety razor for Sally Beauty Supply, which worked very well. The only reason I was considering making the change is because the ""stainless steel paint"" on the Sally Beauty Supply razor had started to peel.

I got this unit expecting the world. However, I've not been able to get a good shave with this product. I figured I'd give it a month to see if I just needed to work on my technique. Alas, no improvement. As soon as I restarted using the old safety razor, I was back in business. I think it's inability to give me a close shave has to do with the bevel of the shave head. It's just too deep. One would have to apply a significant amount of pressure to the skin to get a close enough shave. With my other razor, that's not necessary.

I'll be in the market for anoth product.",I love this thing!,"Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO/FPO addresses.

I've gone through a good number of different types of shave soaps, creams, foams, etc. I wanted to give Proraso a try finally and I'm completely sold on it. For one, it smells amazing - not as menthol-y or strong eucalyptus as you would think; it's more of a masculine ""soapy"" smell with definite undertones of menthol.

Application is nice and simple; no need for a shave mug, endless whipping, etc. This is more of a hard soap/cream hybrid. All you have to do is wet your brush and swirl it around the top until you get sufficient lather. When you apply this to your skin the smell and feeling on the skin is such a treat! For one the smell is just intoxicating, and the menthol + eucalyptus combo feels so nice and cool on your face. Running your razor through is a breeze - easily the smoothest and most effortless shave I've ever had. I didn't even bother to use any aftershave balm as I had absolutely no irritation after shaving, my skin just felt cool and smooth! Did I mention the smell?!?

The container is a snap-on lid and size-wise it about fits in the palm of your hand. The added beauty of this product is that it has good, ""cleaner"" ingredients since its reformulation a couple of years ago. The price is also hard to argue with considering this is shaving soap made in Italy and one container will likely last a year+ given the nature of shave soap.

Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-11-18,"Great product, good lather worth the money",Five Stars,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0

Shaving always felt like a chore, and my skin was often irritated for days afterwards, which meant I didn't shave frequently.  Eventually I got fed up with that and read up on how to shave properly using a double edged safety razor with a shaving soap/brush.  I got myself the necessary components and immediately noticed a big difference both in the actual shaving experience and how my skin felt afterwards.  Since I changed all aspects of my shaving routine at once, I can't say that this shaving soap alone made the difference, but I do know that my current technique is a big improvement over what I'd been doing.

This shave soap feels and smells great.  It's a little bit cooling on your face, which is refreshing, and the smell is pleasant but fairly subtle.  It also lasts a good while; I bought it about a year ago and it's only running out now.  Overall I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to step up their shaving game (you will also need to buy a shaving brush).

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-01-19,Good shaving soap.

Squeeze about 2 centimeter of the Shaving Cream onto your brush, dampen face with warm water, and work the brush into your scruff/stubble. You should be able to achieve an excellent lather in about a minute.', 'If using your hands, work cream and water together between the palm of your hands until suds begin to form. Apply mixture into your stubble using your fingers, massaging in circular movements until a lather forms. This method also works well if youre shaving in the shower.

The razor just feels good in the hand, good weight balance.

I get just as close a shave as with the most expensive disposable, it does how ever take twice as long to shave. The strange part is that I actually enjoy shaving now, go figure! I think it is because this style of razor forces one to slow down and take onbe's time and it relaxes you.

At any rate, for the price of one Mach3 package at Costco that may last 3 months, this razor ($29 plus 100 pack of blades $12) will last me close to two years!

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-01-31,"This soap smells great.

This hair dryer offers the functionality of a higher end dryer for a great price. If you have long hair and want to dry it quickly and comfortably for a reasonable price, this is the product for you. Having used many different brands and styles of hair dryers, I have found that the BaByliss Pro BAB2000 is my favorite by far. I have owned this product since January 2015 and have been very satisfied with its performance.

Advantages:

Cost: While searching for a new hair dryer, I found that dryers can cost anywhere from $10 to $300. At $39.95, the BaByliss Pro is affordable without sacrificing quality.

Function: The BaByliss Pro is a ceramic, which means less damage to your hair. Since I began using this dryer, I have noticed that my hair has more shine and is less frizzy. This dryer has 2000 watts, which means it will dry your hair faster than many of its competitors. With 3 temperature settings (hot, warm, and cool), 2 speed settings (high and low), and a cool shot button, this dryer can be the perfect fit for a wide range of hair types. It also comes with a removable attachment for more focused heat.

Durability: My cat has knocked this dryer off my bathroom counter more than once, and it still works perfectly. The filter on my last blow dryer was metal and dented very easily. I no longer have to worry about that with my BaByliss Pro.

Design: The gripping texture on this dryer makes it comfortable and easy to hold. The sleek black and silver will fit well with any bathroom dcor. The plastic filter is conveniently removable for cleaning which will extend the life of your dryer.

Disadvantages:

Weight: At 2 pounds, this dryer is heavier than ones I have owned in the past. It can get tiresome to hold above my head for long periods. However, I can dry my hair twice as fast with this dryer so the weight is usually not much of an issue.

Heat: Because this dryer is so powerful, the hot setting can actually get too hot. This can be easily fixed by using a lower heat or speed setting. I have fine, thin hair and find that using the dryer on low and warm is perfect.

Overall, you will love the BaByliss Pro as it dries your hair quickly and gently for an affordable price.",Great Deal!,,,1.0

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-07-26,this shaving soap has lasted me almost a year. very good product,very good product,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,False,2015-03-08,Proraso shaving soap (and lotion and aftershave) is the only thing that worked for me for years.

B0007M11XQ,"Proraso Shaving Cream, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","The original Proraso shaving classic, this refreshing and toning Shaving Soap is formulated for any beard on any man. This creamy soap produces a thick, elastic lather and is enriched with natural ingredients that make it particularly concentrated and rich.

Eucalyptus Oil tones and purifies your facial hair and skin, Menthol helps refresh and revitalize, and Glycerin helps the blade glide smoothly and reduce razor burn and rashes. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been innovating professional highest-quality products in the shaving world for generations, and has evolved to become a staple of Italian culture. From the first product -- Pre-Shave Cream -- in 1948, to now, the Martelli family principles hold true: to create professional, quality products that deliver a pleasurable and impeccable shave, in the barbershop and at home.', '', 'Short on time? Apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream to your damp face, for optimal results. If using a shaving brush, run it under hot running water for about 30 seconds (if you don&#039;t have time to soak it). Squeeze about 2 centimeter of the Shaving Cream onto your brush, dampen face with warm water, and work the brush into your scruff/stubble. You should be able to achieve an excellent lather in about a minute.', 'If using your hands, work cream and water together between the palm of your hands until suds begin to form. Apply mixture into your stubble using your fingers, massaging in circular movements until a lather forms. This method also works well if youre shaving in the shower.

I have had numerous batches were the first ~1/3 of the cream in the tube was nice and soft, the next 1/3 was bone dry and the last bit remaining was again just as soft and creamy as in the beginning of the tube.

Apply your favorite Proraso Pre-Shave Cream to your damp face, for optimal results. If using a shaving brush, run it under hot running water for about 30 seconds (if you don&#039;t have time to soak it). Squeeze about 2 centimeter of the Shaving Cream onto your brush, dampen face with warm water, and work the brush into your scruff/stubble. You should be able to achieve an excellent lather in about a minute.', 'If using your hands, work cream and water together between the palm of your hands until suds begin to form. Apply mixture into your stubble using your fingers, massaging in circular movements until a lather forms. This method also works well if youre shaving in the shower. Shave and rinse, following with your favorite Proraso After Shave Balm or Lotion.', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/1f8dc212-b326-426f-ad67-d55012b95e28._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/c673f034-3b1f-4992-9e16-cea2aaac958a._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/f2498900-af97-43d7-99a9-8e2d0d7fd735._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/9c42a36c-2b02-43bb-865e-49906c4720ac._SL220__.jpg"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/2fb1c49e-6064-4a93-8b78-c6ca030b77a1._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/4270214e-0e80-4837-8f85-a07a64b291cc._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/b9fca29b-65be-4e02-b022-4279ad9e3b24._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/ee01f0a9-2380-4b92-9184-deb321f3ca36._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/6dc2540e-ae7d-4799-94e2-4defac670e0c._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/mg/9324ee51-e366-4a31-9f5c-ce192d640d15._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f90caec2-c150-4fa0-b5c2-73ba1eac7a9d._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ml9RDU82L.jpg,5.0,True,2015-04-09,"Great product.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-02-24,I really like this stuff.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-08-31,"if you care about a close shave and like to go old school with a good shave brush this stuff is awesome.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,3.0,True,2015-04-02,Its ok; same as the cream in my opinion.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-07-01,"I wish this contained even more menthol, but the menthol is adequate, and the smell is terrific.",Good Menthol and Wonderful Smell,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0

My hair started to go gray in high school. Now that I'm approaching 50, I've decided to grow out my gray. I'm really curious to see what I look like with a head of gorgeous gray. Unfortunately, there's no easy or fast way to do it. Normally, I would just have to suffer with the unsightly color difference as it grows out. Which is why this product is so great. Since I wear my hair parted on the side and with long bangs, I only need to conceal the gray around the part. This product does that perfectly and it really does last until you wash it out. Incredible. I really didn't expect that. The powder is really dense and highly pigmented so a little goes a long way. SO happy with this product. My hair is a very dark brown and this dark brown shade is perfect camouflage.  That said, this is a powder not a spray or liquid. It's best if you only need to conceal smaller areas. All over head coverage is just not realistic.",Works great! But have realistic expectations,,,1.0

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out.

I've been shaving for a month and haven't had any issues with rusting. It does take longer to shave with a safety razor, but the shave is much cleaner. I am no longer getting razor burn (which has always been a bad problem for me) and I cut myself less often with this razor than a regular razor. Highly recommend switching to a safety razor and this is a great way to start.",This razor is great.

It is the type of razor my grandfather used to use and he was just awesome. You can buy this razor for several reasons; one of which is environmental. You are not throwing away cheap plastic razors all the time. Another reason is its simplicity. Everyone knows the best designs are simple with few moving parts and all parts are accessible.  It is super easy to clean too. When it is clogged with whiskers and shaving cream, just unscrew it a little, loosen it up, rinse it out and then tighten it down and shave on! It has a nice weight to it and makes you feel like you are using something of quality, which of course you are. I bought the
100 pack 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor blades years ago and still have blades. Plus, the blades have two sides. Can you flip your plastic razor 180 degrees and keep shaving?  A third reason is economical; this is by far the cheapest way to shave. Let's assume you are going to shave for years and years. Do the math. Dollar Shave Club is still more expensive. The last reason is the most obvious but like many obvious things, people miss them. You only need ONE blade to shave. Not two, three, four or even six! Here is why: the first blade in these multi-blade razors does the shaving, the others just follow along behind and do nothing. How many knives does a master sushi chef use to cut fish? One. How many times does this chef cut the fish in the same place? Once. Have you ever seen a lawn mower with extra spinning blades that follow the first spinning blade in the same path? I didn't think so. Imagine a man pushing a long lawn mower with six blades one in front of the other. Can this guy really justify such a machine as better at cutting grass?

That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,False,2015-01-14,"I bought this shaving soap as a stocking stuffer for my Dad and he absolutely loves it.

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,5.0,True,2015-11-25,Lasts for a long time.

Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-01-20,"This is a great purchase for people who, like me, love the aroma of eucalyptus and menthol.

To get a five-star rating, I would like to see a thicker lather. But this is a personal preference. It is excellent soap, and I enjoy using it.

Okay, so let me start by saying that I had alopecia (not sure on the spelling) when I was in college. The hair on the sides of my head, right above my ears just thinned out and has never grown back. I always wear my hair down because it's easy to cover the spots with my curly hair. However, if I ever want to wear my hair up, I'm faced with exposing my 2-Half-Dollar-sized bald spots. I've colored in the spots before, but I go through those eye pencils way too quickly and they aren't exactly real looking. These Fibers are the first thing that has really allowed me to wear my hair up and look normal. Don't get me wrong, I'm still keeping an eye out for a hair growth miracle, but in the mean time, this will do. ;)

B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz","Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special ""hot soap"" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png"">', '",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,4.0,True,2015-10-24,"Great lather, nice, but kind of strong scent.",Four Stars,Item can be shipped within U.S.,This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.,1.0

As my son says, ""kind of looks like sparkles."" Not what I want to hear.

I have colored it for years but the older I get, the less flattering it is to have it too dark - especially near the face -  and when I've tried to make it lighter I end up with it looking brassy. I wish there was some sort of semi-permanent color that would just color the grays and have them look like highlights but so far that doesn't exist.

So, for the past several months my hairdresser has only been highlighting and lowlighting my hair and not using any more base color and I think this is going to be the answer for me, but it's been frustrating knowing that I have a ways to go until it looks right and is more fully grown out. The white/gray still stands in too much contrast to the rest of my hair - so I decided  to  give this a try.

I am so glad I did. At first I tried the blonde root cover because I figured that would work best to just highlight the white  but it turns out that for me, the light  brown is best and covers the gray better. The blonde almost leaves it a little gold/orange wheras the light brown turns the gray into more of a carmel/beige which is just what I was looking for.

I use the brush (both ends  work fine for me) and just brush the color on the gray, starting  at the root. If I go too fast a little bit will end up on the scalp but it's light enough to look okay and so much better than having the gray stand out.

Highly highly recommended. It truly adheres to the hair and it doesn't make your hair ""sticky"" like some of the mascara-like coverups.",This was just was I was looking for; makes the grays look like highlights and doesn't make hair sticky,,,1.0
